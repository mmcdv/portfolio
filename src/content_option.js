    problem: "One of the significant challenges I encountered during the development of HomeFinder was integrating an external API to query and display available homes in the user's desired area. This required seamless communication with the RapidAPI service using Axios.",

    solution: "To overcome this challenge, I meticulously designed an Axios-based API integration strategy. I implemented asynchronous functions to fetch data from the RapidAPI service, parse the responses, and dynamically populate the home listings on the HomeFinder platform. Incorporating error handling mechanisms and optimizing API requests, I ensured a smooth and reliable user experience.",

    problem: "During the development process, I encountered a significant challenge related to creating and maintaining a dynamic shopping cart that remains available throughout the entire shopping journey. I also needed to implement the functionality to edit product quantities and sizes seamlessly.",

    solution: "To address this challenge, I utilized createContext, a powerful feature in React for managing global state. I created a centralized shopping cart context that could be accessed and modified from various components across the application. This allowed for real-time updates to the cart as users interacted with the website.",

    outcome: "The implementation of a dynamic and editable shopping cart, powered by createContext, greatly enhanced the user experience. Users can now confidently add, review, and adjust their selections throughout their shopping journey. This not only improves user satisfaction but also increases the likelihood of successful conversions. This experience reinforced my problem-solving abilities, as I successfully tackled a complex challenge in web development using createContext. It also highlighted the importance of user-centered design and effective state management techniques in creating a user-friendly e-commerce platform",
